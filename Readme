Pennsylvania State Law mandates that all dogs 3 months of age or older must be licensed. Dog Licenses must be purchased by January 1st 
of each year REGARDLESS of when the license was purchased the previous year. State Dog Wardens are performing "License and 
Rabies Compliance Checks" throughout the Commonwealth using PADogLicense.com Real Time system to track unlicensed dogs. State Dog 
Wardens may issue fines up to $300.00 plus court cost per dog for violation of this law.  Please spread the word to family and 
friends on the importance of registering their pets. Please Protect Your Dog, Buy A License, It Is The Law, and it is the only sure 
way to get your dog back home.  REFERENCE http://padoglicense.com/         We have reunited more than "5,695 LOST PETS". Over 540+ pets are 
still missing and are listed on our FREE web site "www.palostpet.com".   

Discuss how the data set changes very little year over year due to the same pet being registered every year over a 10 year period.  
Compared a few single years to the aggregate and that is the case.

An annual license is $8.50 and a lifetime license is $51.50. If the animal is spayed or neutered, the annual fee is $6.50 and lifetime 
is $31.50. Discounts are available to older adults and people with disabilities. The small license fee helps the millions of dogs in 
the state by funding the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture Bureau of Dog Law Enforcement.
