Dog: LicenseType, Breed, Color, DogName, OwnerZip, ExpYear, ValidDate   10 different files from 2007-2016  
Average number of rows per file = 30,000

As of November 2016, the American Kennel Club (AKC) recognizes 202 different breeds of dogs; however, the data set shows 344 unique
breeds.  That is because there are many listings for "mixed", for "designer" dogs like Labradoodles (cross between Labrador Retriever 
and Poodle = temperment of Lab but don't shed), and some for breeds that are not recognized by the AKC.  Additionally, there 
appears to be a lack of standard nomenclature, for example, there are a few abbreviations that result in duplicates and "puppy" and 
"tag" appear but only twice in the 2016 dataset.  

A count of blank fields is summarized in the Jupyter notebook.  The actual 2016 data file was scanned for other missing data:  
(1.) Breed is populated as "." for 0.1% of the entries and "other" for 0.2% of the entries
(2.) Name is populated as "?" or some version of "Not given" for 0.1% of the entries
(3.) Color is populates as "." or "Other" in 1% of the entries
The flaws in the dataset were deemed insignificant and were not treated.

Pennsylvania State Law mandates that all dogs 3 months of age or older must be licensed. Dog Licenses must be purchased by January 1st 
of each year REGARDLESS of when the license was purchased the previous year. State Dog Wardens are performing "License and 
Rabies Compliance Checks" throughout the Commonwealth using PADogLicense.com Real Time system to track unlicensed dogs. State Dog 
Wardens may issue fines up to $300.00 plus court cost per dog for violation of this law.  Please spread the word to family and 
friends on the importance of registering their pets. Please Protect Your Dog, Buy A License, It Is The Law, and it is the only sure 
way to get your dog back home.  REFERENCE http://padoglicense.com/         We have reunited more than "5,695 LOST PETS". Over 540+ pets 
are still missing and are listed on our FREE web site "www.palostpet.com".   

Discuss how the data set changes very little year over year due to the same pet being registered every year over a 10 year period.  
Compared a few single years to the aggregate and that is the case.  The 10 csv files were merged merely for the learning exercise than
to enrich the data set and improve accuracy.

An annual license is $8.50 and a lifetime license is $51.50. If the animal is spayed or neutered, the annual fee is $6.50 and lifetime 
is $31.50. Discounts are available to older adults and people with disabilities. The small license fee helps the millions of dogs in 
the state by funding the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture Bureau of Dog Law Enforcement.

Data is for 160 different zip codes in PA.  There are a total of 2,174 zip codes in PA for 67 counties.  Looking at the top zip codes by
count, all of the locations are within a 15 mile radius of Pittsburgh.  So there are about 30,000 dogs JUST within that small area.  
There are millions of licenced dogs in the state of Pennslyvania.
