#Analysis of Largest Dog Breed Dataset(Ref. 1)

##Introduction

The Largest Dog Breed Dataset consists of 10 different .csv files; one for each of the years 2007 through 2016.  The same seven columns 
appear in each file; LicenseType, Breed, Color, DogName, OwnerZip, ExpYear, ValidDate.  The average number of rows per file is 
about 30,000.    

The origination of the data set is related to the Pennsylvania State Law that mandates all dogs 3 months of age or older must be 
licensed. Dog Licenses must be purchased by January 1st of each year regardless of when the license was purchased the previous year.  
An annual license is $8.50 and a lifetime license is $51.50. Discounts are available to older adults and people with disabilities 
(Ref. 2); hence the different listings in the LicenseType column. 

The license fee funds the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture Bureau of Dog Law Enforcement.  State Dog Wardens perform "License and 
Rabies Compliance Checks" throughout the Commonwealth using PADogLicense.com Real Time system to track unlicensed dogs. State Dog 
Wardens may issue fines up to $300.00 plus court cost per dog for violation of this law.  One of the benefits of licensing is dog owners
can use a free website to possibly be reunited with their lost pet (Ref. 3). More 5,695 lost pets have been reunited with their owners
and over 540 pets still missing.   

Discuss how the data set changes very little year over year due to the same pet being registered every year over a 10 year period.  
Compared a few single years to the aggregate and that is the case.  The 10 csv files were merged merely for the learning exercise than
to enrich the data set and improve accuracy.

As of November 2016, the American Kennel Club (AKC) recognizes 202 different breeds of dogs; however, the data set shows 344 unique
breeds.  That is because there are many listings for "mixed", for "designer" dogs like Labradoodles (cross between Labrador Retriever 
and Poodle = temperment of Lab but don't shed), and some for breeds that are not recognized by the AKC.  Additionally, there 
appears to be a lack of standard nomenclature.  For example, there are a few abbreviations that result in duplicates and "puppy" and 
"tag" appear but only twice in the 2016 dataset.  

A count of blank fields is summarized in the Jupyter notebook.  The actual 2016 data file was scanned for other missing data:  
(1.) Breed is populated as "." for 0.1% of the entries and "other" for 0.2% of the entries
(2.) Name is populated as "?" or some version of "Not given" for 0.1% of the entries
(3.) Color is populates as "." or "Other" in 1% of the entries

The flaws described above were deemed insignificant and were not treated.

Data is for 160 different zip codes in PA.  There are a total of 2,174 zip codes in PA for 67 counties.  Looking at the top zip codes by
count, all of the locations are within a 15 mile radius of Pittsburgh.  So there are about 30,000 dogs JUST within that small area.  
There are millions of licenced dogs in the state of Pennslyvania.
